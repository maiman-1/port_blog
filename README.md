Hello. I'm Muhammad Aiman bin Shamsiemon. Currently a student in Monash University
Malaysia. I am 21 years old and currently studying in my second year of my
Bachelor of Software Engineering degree. I made this website to showcase several
of my projects that I've done as assignments in my degree and if there's a chance,
I'll try to show any personal projects that I've done ass well.

This is one of the Jekyll theme supported by GitHub pages, known as Cayman.
You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic
Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

To make this website, I followed the instructions on this playlist:
[Mike Dane's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB)
