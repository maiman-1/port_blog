In the second year of my studies in **Software Engineering**, I had to take on
a software development management unit. The unit lets us develop a project in
a team for our final project.

The unit titled **FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management**
emphasizes teaching about a particular type of management technique in
software development known as **AGILE Scrum**. This type of management
technique focuses on delivering a working product in increment to the client.
There's no in depth analysis of what the client wants, instead, build a working
prototype and asks the client if what is being delivered works for them or not.

This type of management technique relies on the fact that the client themselves
may not fully understand what they want out of a product and works around any
future problems that may occur due to the client changing his minds on the
requirement of the system.

In the final project of this unit. We were divided into teams and were told
to create a project management software for lecturers to use to keep track of
their students' assignment progress. Since this is a management unit, the emphasis
is mostly on the documentation of the product, instead of the quality of the
product. Obviously, a product that does not work reflects poorly on the management
of the team but, that is not main criteria that is looked at in this project.

One of the tools we used for this unit is [Trello](https://trello.com) which is
a type of Kanban, a scheduling management technique. Basically, based on the
requirements, we created a list of tasks that is categorized acording to their
progress. Trello made this easier since the tasks can be made into cards which
can be dragged to different boards based on their categories. The picture below
shows how the board looks like at the end of the project.

We also used git with quite a bit of branches since 5 members are involved in
the team. At the end of the day, we were able to complete a workable product.

In the team, I play the role of QA tester which primarily deals with checking
boxes to make sure the requirement for the project is delivered. I mostly deal
with blackbox testing although, in hindsight, if I had more time to work on the
project, I should have use unit testing, which can be used alongside git that
will life a lot easier.
